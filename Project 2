Overview:
This analysis reviews the current network architecture of a fictional small business. The
organization operates a flat network with no segmentation and minimal monitoring.
Network Components Reviewed:
• ISP modem + router combo device
• Single unmanaged switch
• 12 workstations
• 1 file server
• Cloud database connection
• Guest Wi-Fi network 
Findings:
1. Default router login credentials were still active.
2. No network segmentation—everything shared the same broadcast domain.
3. Open ports (22, 80, 445, 3389) discovered and not monitored.
4. Guest Wi-Fi was bridged to the internal network.
5. No IDS/IPS present for packet inspection.
6. Firewall logging disabled.
Recommendations:
• Change all default router and admin passwords.
• Create VLANs: Workstations, Servers, Guest, VoIP.
• Disable unused ports and implement port-security.
• Enable firewall logging and regular monitoring.
• Introduce an IDS/IPS tool such as Snort or Suricata.
Separate guest Wi-Fi from internal LAN immediately.
Conclusion:
The network is functional but insecure. Implementing segmentation, credential hardening, and
monitoring will significantly improve the security posture and reduce the attack surface.
