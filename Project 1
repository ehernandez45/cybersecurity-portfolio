Project 1: Security Audit Report
Overview:
This security audit evaluates a fictional small business with 10 employees, a local file server,
Wi-Fi network, and cloud-hosted CRM system. The objective is to identify risks, review existing
policies, and recommend security improvements.
Scope:
• User account and password policy review
• Operating system hardening review
• Network and Wi-Fi security review
• Software update and patching status
• Access control and permission structure assessment
Key Findings:
1. Passwords were not enforced to meet complexity requirements.
2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) was not enabled for any critical system.
3. Local administrator accounts existed on every workstation.
4. Windows systems were missing patches older than 60 days.
5. Wi-Fi router was using WPA2-Personal with a weak password.
6. File share permissions were overly permissive (“Everyone: Read/Write”).
Recommendations:
• Enforce MFA across all systems.
• Remove unnecessary local admin accounts.
• Implement a patch management schedule.
• Strengthen the Wi-Fi security to WPA3 and rotate passwords quarterly.
• Apply the principle of least privilege for all file shares. Deploy centralized logging for better visibility.
Conclusion:
The business has foundational controls but lacks critical security practices. Implementing the
recommended improvements will drastically reduce exposure to unauthorized access and malware.
